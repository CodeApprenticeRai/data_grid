This is cool and nice but it took me two hours to set the 
the grid dimensions correctly and set each cell to grow on hover.
My goal next is to:
* Fix the hover transition so that the underlying border doesn't show onhover.
* Publish a version of the grid.
* Add Cat Species or Ants or some other Kind of Animal or Thing.
* Publish.
